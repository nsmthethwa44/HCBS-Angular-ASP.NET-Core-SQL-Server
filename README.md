Healthcare Appointment Booking System - Angular-ASP.NET-Core-SQL-Server

🔹 Overview

The Healthcare Appointment Booking System is a full-stack web application built with ASP.NET Core Web API, Angular, and SQL Server. It enables patients to book medical appointments, doctors to manage schedules, and administrators to oversee the platform. Designed with a clean, scalable architecture, the system simplifies appointment management, reduces scheduling conflicts, and improves communication between patients and healthcare providers.

❗ The Problem

Traditional appointment booking often relies on manual phone calls, paper-based scheduling, or outdated systems, which lead to double bookings, inefficient communication, and missed appointments. Administrators struggle to manage doctors’ availability and patients face delays due to lack of transparency.

💡 The Solution

This system digitizes the entire process by providing:

Patients: Online appointment booking, view history, and notifications.

Doctors: Schedule management, patient appointment tracking.

Administrators: Role-based access to manage doctors, patients, and reports.

It uses JWT authentication for secure access, RBAC for role-specific actions, and Entity Framework Core for efficient database interactions.

🎯 Key Benefits

Efficiency: Reduces scheduling conflicts and manual paperwork.

Transparency: Patients, doctors, and admins share a unified view of appointments.

Security: JWT authentication and RBAC ensure proper authorization and data privacy.

Scalability: Built with SOLID principles and clean code, making the system easy to extend.
